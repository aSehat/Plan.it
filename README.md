# Plan.it
AMP stack personal management application

Practice with AMP stack development. 

"Plan it, Assign it, Do it and Review It" 

The better you perform, the better the health of your 'PlanIt'

# How To Use

The current version of plan.it runs on the localhost and requires the user to use phpMyAdmin to create a new database called itproject. To initialize, run the sql file initialize.sql on itproject. This will set up the needed schema and insert a few values for demonstrative purposes. From here the website will automaticly add entries into the database as the user interacts with the site.
